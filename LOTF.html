    <h1> Lord of the Flies: Simon's Murder</h1>
    <h5> Simon's brutal murder in William Golding's <i>Lord of the Flies</i> illustrates 
        fear as a driving force for violence. Simon was mistaken as the “beast” 
        during a barbaric ritual dance, resulting in a gruesome attack by the group 
        of boys. Almost as if the group had reverted to their animalistic instincts, 
        they “surged after [Simon], poured down the rock, leapt on to the beast, 
        screamed, struck, bit, tore” (Golding 214). The group was so scared of the 
        concept of a beast that they lost all rationality, blindly lashing out, despite 
        Simon’s pleas, in hopes of asserting control over their perceived threat. Through 
        the use of concise, monosyllabic language, Golding quickens the pace, heightening 
        the urgency and portraying the boys as consumed by fear. The vivid image of the attack 
        captures the intensity of their fear-induced violence, highly contrasting with their 
        supposed civilized upbringing. This stark juxtaposition underscores the transformative 
        power of fear, revealing how much of an influence it can have on human behavior. </h5>
