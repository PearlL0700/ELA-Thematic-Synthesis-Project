    <h1> Naruto: Momentary Freeze</h1>
    <h5> 
        In episode eight of Naruto, titled "The Oath of Pain," Naruto's fear 
        prompts personal growth by urging him to overcome his struggles. Naruto 
        and his friends are ninjas on a mission to escort a bridge builder. Suddenly, 
        bandits attacked them, faced with their menacing weapons – spinning saw blades 
        on their arms and intimidating muzzles covering their faces – Naruto froze, 
        endangering his comrades. However, this moment of vulnerability makes him 
        realize the gravity of his hesitation and the potential consequences of his fear. 
        This results in him taking an oath of pain, stabbing his hand, and vowing never to 
        allow his fear to jeopardize the safety of his friends again. The oath suggests that 
        Naruto acknowledges his shortcomings and has the resolve to overcome them. It also 
        demonstrates his open-mindedness and willingness to grow, underscoring just how 
        regretful he is that he let his fear dictate his actions. Later, when Naruto faces 
        the same bandits again, the recollection of his oath of pain encourages him to take 
        action. Drawing strength from his vow, Naruto bravely confronts the bandits, freeing 
        his mentor and saving his friends. It is his fear of endangering his friends that 
        prompted him to rise above his limitations. This demonstrates how Naruto's fear, while 
        initially hindering him, ultimately leads to his personal growth and makes him stronger and more resilient.
