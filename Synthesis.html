        reflecting the complex interplay between instinctual response and moral development.</h6>
    
    <h2> Synthesis Paragraph</h2>
    <h6>
        The texts <i>Lord of the Flies</i>, <i>Ender’s Game</i>, Naruto, and 
        <i>Learning from the Salem Witch Trials: Polarization, Fear, and Reconciliation</i> 
        show the complex nature of fear as a driving force in how humans behave. While 
        <i>Lord of the Flies</i> and the Salem Witch Trials highlight fear’s role in inciting violence, 
        <i>Ender’s Game</i> and Naruto depict fear as a motivator for personal growth. 
        In <i>Lord of the Flies</i>, the boys tear Simon to death with their “teeth and claws,” 
        demonstrating how fear can distort perception and fuel irrational behavior, pressuring 
        individuals to abandon their humanity in the face of perceived threats to maintain control (Golding 214). 
        Similarly, in <i>Learning from the Salem Witch Trials: Polarization, Fear, and Reconciliation</i>, 
        fear drives individuals to extreme measures, after “losing their desperate war with the American Indians,” 
        the colonists turned on one another out of suspicion and desperation; the fear of being oppressed by another 
        group weighing on their minds (O’Reilly 1). Using violence as a coping mechanism, the brutal murder of Simon, 
        along with the victims of the Salem Witch Trials, serves as a reminder of the lengths to which fear can drive individuals, 
        leading them to surrender their moral compass and succumb to violence as a means of asserting power and dominance. 
        Conversely, in <i>Ender’s Game</i>, Ender, due to his fears of being “just like” Peter, actively tries to be the 
        opposite of him, embracing empathy and compassion, assisting in the development of his moral compass (Card 33). 
        Likewise, in Naruto, Naruto’s oath of pain, born from his fear of endangering his friends, allows him to overcome 
        those fears and emerge a better, braver ninja. Pairing these diverse texts through the common theme of fear deepens 
        understanding by showcasing the range of human responses to fear and highlighting its power to shape individuals. 
        This synthesis reveals that fear is not inherently destructive but can lead to negative and positive outcomes depending 
        on how the individual chooses to confront it. By exploring these different interpretations, readers gain insight into the 
        complexities of human nature and the ways individuals navigate fear in their lives. This conversation is vital as it prompts 
        reflection on how fear influences human thinking, actions, and storytelling. Ultimately, these texts emphasize the significance 
        of empathy, compassion, and courage in overcoming fear and shaping a more humane society.
